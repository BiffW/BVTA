A RP version of BVTA, the only difference is that this version disallow you to put ammunitions on the hotbar slots

This mod overrides every ammunition for turrets to make them more convenient to use and easier to get

* All
  - Deconstruction yield changed
  - Price changed (mostly lowered, some increased)

* Ammo boxes
  - Can be combined
  - Can use different ammobox of the same turret as "recycle" material

* Nuclear shell
  - New inventory icon (clearer than old one)

* Chaingun Shredder Ammunition Box
  - Old sprite (I personally don't like the new green one)

It also makes a lot of balance changes to make their capability match the prices better.
