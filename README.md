A mod for indie game Barotrauma  

Last tested game version: 0.19.14.0  

This mod overrides every ammunition for turrets to make them more convenient to use and easier to get

* All
  - Can be put in the hotbar slots
  - Deconstruction yield changed
  - Price changed

* Ammobox
  - Can be combined
  - Can use different ammobox of the same turret as "recycle" material

* Nuclear shell
  - New inventory icon (clearer than old one)

* Chaingun Shredder Ammunition Box
  - Old sprite (I personally don't like the new green one)

It also makes a lot of balance changes. (there can be missing some though)

* Railgun
  - All shells have significantly higher sever probability
  - All shells (except canister) have 2 slots instead of 1
  - Steel Shell costs no iron and afflicts more damage
  - Physicorium Shell costs no titanium and afflicts more damage
  - Nuclear Shell afflicts more damage
  - Canister Shell contains 24 pellets instead of 11

  - Explosive Ammo Box costs double C-4 and contains 200 rounds instead of 100
  - Piercing Ammo Box contains 200 rounds instead of 149
  - Depleted Fuel Bolt afflicts more damage but less radiation sickness. However the maximum radiation sickness afflicted is no more limited
  - Depleted Fuel Ammo Box is sold by military merchants and armory merchants

* Chaingun
  - All ammo box cost changed, lead ammo cheaper, others more expensive
  - All bolts have higher launch impulse, sever probability and less spread
  - Shredder bolts and Physicorium bolts have higher armor penetration

* Pulse Laser

  - Removed bubbles to improve performance
  - Changed color of Tri-Laser Beam for consistency
